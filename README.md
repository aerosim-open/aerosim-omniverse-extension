# AeroSim Omniverse Extension

This repo contains the AeroSim C++ extension for connecting an Omniverse Kit app to the simulation. It was created using the [Omniverse Kit C++ Extension Template](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/kit-extension-template-cpp) in order to use the `aerosim-world-link` library to communicate with the simulation to load the USD stage and assets from the [AeroSim Asset Library](https://github.com/aerosim-open/aerosim-assets).

See the [AeroSim repo](https://github.com/aerosim-open/aerosim) for instructions on how to install and use this as a sim renderer.
